## Starting with HTML
For this design I started coding all of the web elements in html before moving to css. I wanted to make sure that I included all necessary information before trying to style anything to ensure that the page was not missing any crucial information.

### The Header

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/madFish2020/UX_UI_HW_17/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
